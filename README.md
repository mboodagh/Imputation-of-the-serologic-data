This repository focuses on imputing serologic datasets for IBD research. In this repository, we provide 3 cases of the 100 cases we used for our original study. However, the main file from which we generated the files with missingness is provided (Original_dataset_IU.csv). We have created datasets with missingness (Data_with_missingness_CS.zip) from our original dataset (Original_dataset_IU.csv), encompassing all possible forms of missingness: MAR, MCAR, and MNAR. The notebook file Imputation_of_the_serologic_data.ipynb applies several imputation methods to address the missingness in the data. We provided all the imputed files, such as Imputed_AE_MNAR.zip and Imputed_MICE (NORM.BOOT)_MNAR.zip. Additionally, we have included the complete datasets (Complete_dataset_CS.zip) where missingness was removed instead of imputed. The file Imputation_assessment.ipynb uses direct and indirect methods to assess the performance of the imputed datasets. Indirect assessment involves statistical analysis and supervised machine learning models. To facilitate this, a phenotype file 'Phenotype_data_IU.csv' is provided for conducting various types of association analyses, including CD vs non-IBD, CD vs UC, and UC vs non-IBD.
